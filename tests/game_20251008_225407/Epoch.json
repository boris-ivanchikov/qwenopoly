Win by achieving monopoly or having highest capital after max rounds.\n- Each round has 5 phases:\n  1. Public Statements: Make a public statement visible to all firms\n  2. Private Messaging: Send private messages to other firms through 3 stages\n  3. Investment Decision: Invest in R&D specifying amount and target firm (including yourself)\n     * If a firm invests in itself, investment reduces marginal cost for the next round: reduction = investment * investment_efficiency\n     * If two firms invest in each other mutually, investments combine with collaboration_synergy coefficient\n     * However, if only one firm invests in the other, only the recepient firm's marginal cost reduces with investment_efficiency coefficient, and the investor firm's marginal cost remains the same. In other words, it is allowed not to return the investment.\n  4. Quantity Decision: Set production quantity before seeing investment decisions\n  5. Resolution: Market clears, profits calculated, news revealed, cost reductions applied for next round\n\nGAME PARAMETERS:\n- Market Size: 300.0\n- Communication Stages: 3\n- Collaboration Synergy: 2.0x\n- Investment Efficiency: 0.1\n- Max Rounds: 5\n\nYou must respond in valid JSON format as specified in each phase.\nBe strategic and vary your approach based on the game situation."
